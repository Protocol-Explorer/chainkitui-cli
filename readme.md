# ChainKitUI

ChainKitUI is a CLI tool designed to simplify the process of integrating Web3 components into your React applications. It provides an easy way to use pre-built components commonly used in Web3 applications while still being flexible enough to customize each component to your needs. Inspired heavily by shadcn/ui ChainKitUI serves to give you a base that you can customize for your specific needs. 

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Quickly add Web3 components to your React projects.
- **Component Selection**: Choose from a range of ready-to-use components.
- **Automatic Dependency Management**: Automatically installs necessary dependencies like `ethers`.
- **Prebuilt Templates**: Access a collection of templates that can be quickly integrated into your project.
- **Contract Interaction Functions**: Generate typesafe functions to interact with smart contracts.

## Installation

ChainKitUI is designed to be used with `npx`, so there's no need for a global installation. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

## Usage

To use ChainKitUI, navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal and run:

```bash

npx chainkitui
